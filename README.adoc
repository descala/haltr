PDF, UBL and facturae.

These are some of its features:

== Generating PDFs

Haltr uses wkhtmltopdf to generate PDF files.

In order to run wkhtmltopdf in a headless server you can use xvfb.

In Debian:

  apt-get install wkhtmltopdf xvfb

then, put this script in /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf

  #!/bin/sh
  xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 640x480x16" /usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf $*

do not forget to give it execution permisions

  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf

== Sending invoices by email

Haltr is designed for use with an external mailing system, to allow to
manipulate invoice file before sending it. In Spain we must digitally sign
invoices before sending them.

In settings, "*Path of export folders*" is where Haltr leaves invoices, and
expects another process scheduled to take them, do whatever transformation is
needed, send them and report the status change to Haltr.

To report invoice status changes, Haltr provides a RESTful access to an
``Event`` model, which has a particular name and invoice ID.

For example:

  Event.new(:invoice_id => 1, :name => "success_sending")

would change the status of the invoice with id 1, from "Sending" to "Sent".

Access to the REST service is restricted by source IP, so that events can only
be created from the IP that has been set in "*B2brouter IP*"

Finally, "*B2brouter URL*" is the URL where Haltr retrieves the invoices
already signed, so that they can be downloaded.

The call looks like this:

  "#{b2brouter_url}/b2b_messages/get_legal_invoice?md5=#{md5}"
