# start guard in another terminal
guard -G plugins/haltr/Guardfile

##### ISSUES #####

# In redmine-2.3 some fixtures do not load.
# Remove them

rm -rf test/fixtures/configuration/

# running all tests on guard crashes due to this bug: https://github.com/burke/zeus/issues/352
# hopefully fixed in next zeus release, but you can still run all tests with:
zeus test plugins/haltr/test

# changing some models fully reloads zeus, making it so slow: https://github.com/burke/zeus/issues/433#issuecomment-31518132

# https://github.com/guard/guard-minitest/pull/98
# tests run twice after saving file on vim. To avoid this, use last guard-minitest from github (included in bundle):
bundle exec guard -G plugins/haltr/Guardfile
